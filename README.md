# Hello World

My name is Daniel, I am a VERY entry level programmer with past experience in C# developing some "fun things" for games. I took a break simply because I wanted too, and now I'm clueless
how to execute C# anymore, much less other programming languages. I'm currently doing schooling for Comp. Sci (Yeah yeah I know) and digital work for cybersecurity. I am hoping to hone my skills again. Thanks for reading,
and welcome to my incredibly mediocre github page.
